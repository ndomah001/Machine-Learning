# Machine Learning
## ❓ What is Machine Learning
**Machine learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions based on data. It allows computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. In essence, the system improves its performance over time as it is exposed to more data.

In bioinformatics, ML is used to extract meaningful insights from large and complex biological datasets, where traditional methods might struggle. Machine learning is revolutionizing bioinformatics by enabling automated analysis of complex biological data, allowing researchers to make more accurate predictions and discoveries in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other fields.
